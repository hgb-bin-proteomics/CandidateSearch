# CandidateSearch

Implements a search engine that uses [CandidateVectorSearch](https://github.com/hgb-bin-proteomics/CandidateVectorSearch) to get the best candidates for a given spectrum.

## Limitations

- Only tryptic digestion
- No N- or C-terminal modifications
- Only one modification per amino acid
- Only spectra in centroid mode
